# Chapter 17 Closure Todo

- Parent README: [README.md](./README.md)
- Gap checklist: [ch17-gap-closure-checklist.md](./ch17-gap-closure-checklist.md)
- Manuscript source: [ch17-arxiv-manuscript.md](./ch17-arxiv-manuscript.md)
- Formal ledger: [companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md](./companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md)

This is the short, tool-based list of what still remains before the Chapter 17 formal boundary can honestly be called closed.

## Right Now

- [ ] Mechanize `THM-RECURSIVE-COARSENING-SYNTHESIS` so Betti synthesizes quotient witnesses and aggregate coarse nodes from verified subgraphs.
  Tool surfaces: [ch17-arxiv-manuscript.md](./ch17-arxiv-manuscript.md), [companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md](./companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md), [companion-tests/formal/README.md](./companion-tests/formal/README.md), [companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/InterferenceCoarsening.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/InterferenceCoarsening.lean), [`open-source/gnosis/GnosisProofs.lean`](../../../../gnosis/GnosisProofs.lean), [`open-source/gnosis/src/betty/stability.ts`](../../../../gnosis/src/betty/stability.ts), [`open-source/gnosis/src/betty/lean.ts`](../../../../gnosis/src/betty/lean.ts)
  Current floor: `THM-RENORMALIZATION-COARSENING` already closes the manual many-to-one witness and one-node measurable renormalization surface, but the quotient operator and aggregate coarse node still have to be hand-constructed.
  Next useful move: extend the Betti-to-Lean bridge from manually supplied `ManyToOneGraphQuotient` data to syntax-derived fibers, aggregate-node emission, and recursive drift-certificate discharge.

- [ ] Synthesize measurable small sets, minorization data, and non-queue kernels from `.gg` syntax instead of stopping at the bounded affine queue-family `continuousHarris` witness.
  Tool surfaces: [companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md](./companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md), [companion-tests/formal/README.md](./companion-tests/formal/README.md), [companion-tests/formal/lean/README.md](./companion-tests/formal/lean/README.md), [`open-source/gnosis/GnosisProofs.lean`](../../../../gnosis/GnosisProofs.lean), [`open-source/gnosis/src/betty/stability.ts`](../../../../gnosis/src/betty/stability.ts), [`open-source/gnosis/src/betty/lean.ts`](../../../../gnosis/src/betty/lean.ts)
  Current floor: Betti can already emit bounded affine `*_measurable_observable`, `*_measurable_observable_drift`, and `*_measurable_continuous_harris_certified` queue theorems when syntax supplies `observable_kind`, `observable`, `observable_scale`, `observable_offset`, and `drift_gap` with `0 < driftGap <= observableScale`.
  Next useful move: lower richer continuous `.gg` observables into measurable kernels that carry compiler-synthesized small-set and minorization witnesses rather than queue-family hardwiring.

- [ ] Tighten the Jackson envelope ladder from the current residual-certified convergence scaffold to a sharper closed-form local certificate.
  Tool surfaces: [JacksonQueueing.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/JacksonQueueing.lean)
  Current floor: the package already has the generic finite-step family `throughputEnvelopeApprox n`, with `n = 0` the global envelope, `n = 1` the nodewise `localThroughputEnvelope`, `n = 2` the deeper `secondOrderThroughputEnvelope`, the descending-ladder theorem `throughputEnvelopeApprox_succ_le`, the scalar residual/error certificates, the lower-side residual certificate, the formal lower/upper bracket `(trafficApprox lowerStep).toReal ≤ α_spec ≤ throughputEnvelopeApprox upperStep`, and now the routing-shaped node-local residual ladder `throughputResidualApprox n`.
  Next useful move: derive a closed-form certificate or a still-sharper local certificate beyond the current ladder-plus-node-local-residual scaffold.

- [ ] Synthesize richer adaptive Lyapunov decompositions from raw adaptive kernels instead of from caller-supplied score fields.
  Tool surfaces: [Axioms.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/Axioms.lean), [StateDependentQueueFamilies.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/StateDependentQueueFamilies.lean)
  Current floor: the shell already supports minimum-slack, normalized nonnegative scores, positive-part normalized real scores, explicit selectors, normalized weighted decompositions, raw service-slack scores, and raw routing-pressure scores.
  Next useful move: derive still-richer decomposition identities directly from arbitrary chosen Lyapunov expressions, beyond the current built-in minimum-slack/score/service-slack/routing-pressure families.

## Next After That

- [ ] Close the sleep-debt homology as a bounded theorem-and-data package before moving it into the manuscript.
  Tool surfaces: [ch17-sleep-debt-homology-note.md](./ch17-sleep-debt-homology-note.md), [ch17-sleep-debt-calibration-sources.md](./ch17-sleep-debt-calibration-sources.md), [ch17-sleep-debt-state-space-bridge.md](./ch17-sleep-debt-state-space-bridge.md), [companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md](./companion-tests/formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md), [companion-tests/formal/SleepDebt.tla](./companion-tests/formal/SleepDebt.tla), [companion-tests/formal/SleepDebtScheduleThreshold.tla](./companion-tests/formal/SleepDebtScheduleThreshold.tla), [companion-tests/formal/SleepDebtWeightedThreshold.tla](./companion-tests/formal/SleepDebtWeightedThreshold.tla), [companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/SleepDebt.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/SleepDebt.lean), [companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/SleepDebtSchedule.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/SleepDebtSchedule.lean), [companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/SleepDebtWeightedSchedule.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/SleepDebtWeightedSchedule.lean), [companion-tests/artifacts/sleep-debt-bounded-witness.md](./companion-tests/artifacts/sleep-debt-bounded-witness.md), [companion-tests/artifacts/sleep-debt-schedule-threshold-witness.md](./companion-tests/artifacts/sleep-debt-schedule-threshold-witness.md), [companion-tests/artifacts/sleep-debt-weighted-threshold-witness.md](./companion-tests/artifacts/sleep-debt-weighted-threshold-witness.md)
  Current floor: the bounded abstract recovery package already exists and is mechanized as `THM-SLEEP-DEBT`, the coarse repeated-cycle threshold analog is mechanized as `THM-SLEEP-SCHEDULE-THRESHOLD`, and the integerized `20.2 h` bridge is mechanized as `THM-SLEEP-WEIGHTED-THRESHOLD`; the remaining gap is biological calibration and external empirical support rather than the absence of any executable witness.
  Closure condition: upgrade the bounded abstract witness into a bounded biological correspondence with calibrated observables, matching constructive theorems, and a reproducible external dataset for residual debt, capacity loss, and intrusion-style local venting under truncated recovery.

- [ ] Extend beyond bounded exact multiclass/open-network witnesses.
  Tool surfaces: [QueueingProbabilisticNetworkKernel.tla](./companion-tests/formal/QueueingProbabilisticNetworkKernel.tla), [QueueingProbabilisticLargeNetworkKernel.tla](./companion-tests/formal/QueueingProbabilisticLargeNetworkKernel.tla), [JacksonQueueing.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/JacksonQueueing.lean)
  Closure condition: exact multiclass/open-network semantics are no longer limited to the current bounded witness geometries.

- [ ] Add richer timing or service-law families beyond the current finite-support or discretized witnesses.
  Tool surfaces: [QueueStability.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/QueueStability.lean), [MeasureQueueing.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/MeasureQueueing.lean)
  Closure condition: richer service-time distributions preserve the same balance or recurrence conclusions without collapsing back to discretized witnesses.

- [ ] Replace the current bounded-family recurrence route with a genuinely generic unbounded state-dependent positive-recurrence engine.
  Tool surfaces: [QueueStability.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/QueueStability.lean), [Axioms.lean](./companion-tests/formal/lean/Lean/ForkRaceFoldTheorems/Axioms.lean)
  Closure condition: the recurrence layer no longer depends on bounded-family or explicit finite-state witness packaging.

- [ ] Add strict latency or deadline-style guarantees instead of queue-length and mean-balance statements alone.
  Tool surfaces: [companion-tests/README.md](./companion-tests/README.md), [companion-tests/formal/README.md](./companion-tests/formal/README.md)
  Closure condition: the package proves or checks deadline and worst-case waiting-time obligations, not only occupancy or mean-balance facts.
