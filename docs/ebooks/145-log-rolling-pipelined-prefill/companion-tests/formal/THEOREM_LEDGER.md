## Interpretation

- `Mechanized` means machine-checked by TLC and/or Lean build.
- `Mechanized (assumption-parameterized)` means the theorem is proved as an implication from explicitly declared assumptions; changing assumptions changes theorem applicability.
- Entries tied to `Axioms.lean` encode theorem schemas; entries tied to `Claims.lean` encode constructive proofs over explicit model definitions.
