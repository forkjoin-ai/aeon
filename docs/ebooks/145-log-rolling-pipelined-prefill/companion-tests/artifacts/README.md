## Quantum Ablation Snapshot

- Protocol label: `quantum-recombination-ablation-v1`
- Predicted loss matrix recovered: `yes`
- `linear`: preserves kernel agreement, partition additivity, order invariance, and cancellation
- `winner-take-all`: breaks all four invariants on the selected witnesses
- `early-stop`: breaks all four invariants on the selected witnesses

## Toy Attention Snapshot

- Protocol label: `toy-attention-fold-ablation-v2`
- Predicted ranking recovered: `yes`
- `linear`: mean squared error `0.000`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `1.000`
- `winner-take-all`: mean squared error `0.163`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `0.185`
- `early-stop`: mean squared error `1.071`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `0.074`

- `early-stop`: eval mean squared error `0.735`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `0.000`, cancellation-line abs error `0.764`

## Gnosis Negative Controls Snapshot

- Protocol label: `gnosis-negative-controls-v1`
- All controls pass: `yes`
- Control tasks: `affine-left-only`, `routing-positive-x-only`
- Interpretation: when the task needs only one branch or one expert, the linear-vs-selection separation is expected to disappear, and the artifact reports parity instead of divergence

## Gnosis Near-Control Snapshot

- Protocol label: `gnosis-near-control-sweep-v1`
- Affine last parity / first separated: `0.35` / `0.40`
- Routed last parity / first separated: `0.60` / `0.65`
- Interpretation: parity persists for small nonzero recombination demand, then a measurable linear advantage opens before the broader regime sweep reaches its coarse first-separated endpoints

## Gnosis Regime Sweep Snapshot

- Protocol label: `gnosis-fold-boundary-regime-sweep-v1`
- Affine first separated regime value: `0.50`
- Routed first separated regime value: `0.75`
- Final affine linear advantage (eval MSE): `0.393`
- Final routed linear advantage (eval MSE): `0.111`
- Interpretation: the same topology families start in parity regimes and then separate exactly where additive recombination becomes necessary

## Gnosis Adversarial Controls Snapshot

- Protocol label: `gnosis-adversarial-controls-benchmark-v1`
- All adversarial predictions recovered: `yes`
- Winner-favored task final rank: `winner-take-all < linear < early-stop`
- Early-stop-favored routed task final rank: `early-stop < linear < winner-take-all`
- Early-stop-favored affine task final rank: `early-stop < linear < winner-take-all`
- Interpretation: the learned boundary is symmetric rather than partisan; nonlinear selection wins when the target family rewards sparse selection or budgeted early commitment

## Gnosis Mini-MoE Snapshot

- Protocol label: `gnosis-moe-routing-benchmark-v1`
- Predicted ranking recovered: `yes`
- Shared parameter count: `16`
- `linear`: eval mean squared error `0.001`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `0.978`, dual-active-region abs error `0.027`
- `winner-take-all`: eval mean squared error `0.328`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `0.126`, dual-active-region abs error `0.402`

- `winner-take-all`: eval mean squared error `0.318`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `0.070`, codec/reassembly `1.000`
- `early-stop`: eval mean squared error `0.462`, exact-within-tolerance fraction `0.073`, codec/reassembly `1.000`

## Gnosis MoA Evidence Snapshot

- Protocol label: `gnosis-moa-transformer-evidence-v1`
- Sparse GG primitive: `StructuredMoA`
- Sparse GG topology: `open-source/gnosis/examples/benchmarks/moa-transformer-moa.gg`
- Timing advantage recovered across sweep: `yes`
- Accuracy gap closes with scale: `yes`
- Outer sparsity improves efficiency: `yes`
- Inner sparsity improves efficiency: `yes`
- Under-routing hurts accuracy: `yes`
- Sweep speedup range: `2.56x` to `7.02x`
- Wide-workload eval MSE: MoA `0.0033`, regular `0.0008`
- Interpretation: the sparse GG primitive remains materially faster across the sweep, the raw-accuracy gap narrows at larger workloads, and both outer routing sparsity and inner head sparsity are doing real work rather than decorative pruning

## Chapter 17 MoA Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-moa-transformer-figure-v1`
- Source: `gnosis-moa-transformer-evidence-v1`
- Sparse GG primitive: `StructuredMoA`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Speedup range: `2.56x` to `7.02x`
- Wide-workload accuracy gap: `0.0025`
- Interpretation: the figure packages the sweep speedup, the closing eval-MSE gap, the sparsity-ablation frontier, and the GG topology identity into one manuscript-ready surface

## Chapter 17 Gate 1 Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-gate1-wallclock-figure-v1`
- Source: `workers-dev-external-multihost6-distinct`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Primary cells passed: `8/8`
- Speedup range: `11.785x` to `21.620x`
- Minimum CI lows: `11.365x` and `3,560.98 ms`
- Interpretation: the figure keeps the strongest deployment-style wall-clock claim visible as both absolute latency separation and interval-backed speedup, rather than collapsing the result into a single headline ratio

## Chapter 17 Gate 2 Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-gate2-protocol-corpus-figure-v1`
- Source: `gate2-protocol-corpus-v1`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Primary cells passed: `6/6`
- Framing gain range: `72.252%` to `72.252%`
- Minimum CI lows: `72.190%`, `20.240 ms`, and `19.994 ms`
- Interpretation: the figure separates the almost flat framing advantage from the worsening median and p95 completion gains, so the transport result reads as a corpus trend rather than a single benchmark number

## Chapter 17 Gate 3 Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-gate3-compression-corpus-figure-v1`
- Source: `gate3-compression-corpus-v1`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Primary cells passed: `4/4`
- Gain vs best fixed range: `0.0010%` to `0.833%`
- Gain vs heuristic range: `0.7766%` to `46.37%`
- Minimum primary-cell CI lows: `0.0009%` and `0.386%`
- Interpretation: the figure makes the manuscript's honest compression claim visible by separating the tiny but positive primary-family gains over the best fixed codec from the much larger gains over the heuristic baseline, while leaving the non-primary homogeneous-text control visible

## Chapter 17 Gate 4 Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-gate4-rqr-holdout-figure-v1`
- Source: `gate4-rqr-out-of-sample-v1`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Criteria passed: `5/5`
- Quartile delta: `12.77%` (95% CI `10.01%` to `15.33%`)
- Monotonicity: `1/3` allowed violations
- Interpretation: the figure keeps the `R_qr` validation publication-ready by showing the holdout decile calibration curve and the interval-backed screening criteria side by side, so the predictive claim stays visibly bounded to the tested simulator family

## Chapter 17 Gate 5 Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-gate5-bio-effect-size-figure-v1`
- Source: `gate5-bio-effect-size-v1`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Primary pairs passed: `3/3`
- Minimum primary-pair CI low: `5.829x`
- Pooled geometric ratio: `26.57x` (95% CI `9.863x` to `78.26x`)
- Interpretation: the figure turns the biological analogy section into a reviewable log-scale effect-size map, keeping both pairwise spread and pooled magnitude visible instead of hiding them inside prose examples

## Chapter 17 Inverted-Scaling / Reynolds Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-inverted-scaling-reynolds-figure-v1`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Stage families: `2`, `4`, `8`, `10`
- Maximum overlaid table speedup: `266.667x`
- Transport Reynolds shift: `15.833` (`HTTP/1.1`) to `0.371` (`Aeon Flow`)
- Interpretation: the figure keeps the analytic core of Chapter 17 visible as formulas rather than metaphor alone, showing both the workload-driven speedup growth and the regime shift from turbulent to transitional when chunk capacity widens

## Chapter 17 MoA Topology Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-moa-topology-figure-v1`
- Source: `open-source/gnosis/examples/benchmarks/moa-transformer-moa.gg`
- Sparse GG primitive: `StructuredMoA`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Sparse routed blocks: `2/4`
- Sparse routed heads per live block: `2/4`
- Interpretation: the figure isolates the executable sparse topology itself, showing the selected blocks, selected heads, and the matched dense rotated baseline without folding the result into benchmark metrics

## Chapter 17 MoA Whip Curvature Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-moa-whip-curvature-figure-v1`
- Source topology report: `ch17-moa-topology-figure-v1`
- Sparse GG primitive: `StructuredMoA`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Curvature labels: `curved whip envelope`, `inner whip`, `outer whip snap`
- Sparse routed blocks: `2/4`
- Sparse routed heads per live block: `2/4`
- Interpretation: the supplemental view keeps the same sparse `StructuredMoA` topology but bends the routed paths into a wraparound enclosure so the inner and outer Worthington whips read as curved geometry rather than a straight collapse

## Adaptive Witness Snapshot

- Protocol label: `formal-adaptive-supremum-witness-catalog-v1`
- Witness id: `two-node-adaptive-raw-ceiling`
- Exported `α`: `(1/4, 11/40)`
- Exported drift gap: `1/8`
- Exported spectral radius: `0`
- Interpretation: the Lean theorem package now emits the same concrete adaptive ceiling/drift witness that the runtime adaptive-supremum artifact checks operationally

## Runtime Adaptive Witness Snapshot

- Protocol label: `adaptive-supremum-witness-v1`
- Schedules checked: `4`
- Spectral radius: `0`
- Drift gap: `0.125`
- Interpretation: the runtime mirror operationally checks the bounded-state and schedule consequences of the same concrete adaptive ceiling/drift witness exported from Lean

## Adaptive Family Sweep Snapshot

- Protocol label: `adaptive-supremum-family-sweep-v1`
- Cases checked: `9`
- Family closure recovered: `yes`
- Minimum drift gap: `0.026`
- Tightest case: `tight-right-slack-2x2`
- Interpretation: the bounded two-node adaptive closure is exercised as a raw-parameter family, not just as one manuscript witness tuple

## Sleep-Debt Snapshot

- Protocol label: `sleep-debt-bounded-witness-v1`
- Scenario count: `3`
- Full recovery restores baseline: `yes`
- Partial recovery leaves positive debt: `yes`
- Chronic truncation enables intrusion: `yes`
- Interpretation: this is a bounded executable witness for the sleep-debt recovery geometry, not a human-subject dataset; it only claims residual debt, reduced next-cycle capacity, and threshold intrusion reachability inside the bounded model

## Sleep-Debt Threshold Snapshot

- Protocol label: `sleep-debt-schedule-threshold-witness-v1`
- Scenario count: `3`
- Subcritical schedule stays zero: `yes`
- Critical schedule stays zero: `yes`
- Supercritical schedule grows linearly: `yes`
- Interpretation: this is the coarse repeated-cycle threshold witness for the literature-side bifurcation story, not the full McCauley ODE system

## Sleep-Debt Weighted Threshold Snapshot

- Protocol label: `sleep-debt-weighted-threshold-witness-v1`
- Calibrated critical wake boundary: `20.2 h`
- Subcritical schedule stays zero: `yes`
- Critical schedule stays zero: `yes`
- Supercritical schedule grows linearly: `yes`
- Interpretation: this is an integerized weighted bridge to the literature-side `20.2 h` boundary, not the full McCauley ODE system

## Formal Witness Snapshot

- Protocol label: `formal-fold-boundary-witness-catalog-v1`
- Exported witness count: `7`
- Witness classes: linear exactness, cancellation counterexamples, partition counterexamples, and order counterexamples
- Interpretation: the correspondence-boundary counterexamples are emitted from Lean and consumed directly by the runtime tests

## Chapter 17 Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-correspondence-boundary-figure-v2`
- Sources: `quantum-recombination-ablation-v1`, `toy-attention-fold-ablation-v2`, `gnosis-fold-training-benchmark-v2`, `gnosis-moe-routing-benchmark-v1`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Learned ranking in figure: `linear < winner-take-all < early-stop`

## Boundary Expansion Figure Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-boundary-expansion-figure-v2`
- Sources: `gnosis-near-control-sweep-v1`, `gnosis-fold-boundary-regime-sweep-v1`, `gnosis-adversarial-controls-benchmark-v1`, `formal-fold-boundary-witness-catalog-v1`
- Output surface: JSON + Markdown + SVG
- Interpretation: the expansion figure shows the control-end zoom, where the broader boundary opens, where nonlinear folds legitimately win, and which formal witnesses certify the break

## Replication Pack Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-replication-pack-v1`
- Root command: `cd open-source/aeon/docs/ebooks/145-log-rolling-pipelined-prefill/companion-tests && bun run test:ch17-external-replication`
- Bundle scope: manuscript, workflow, generated artifacts, theorem files, and benchmark topology suites

## External Replication Snapshot

- Protocol label: `ch17-external-replication-v1`
- Step count: `12`
- Manifest stable: `yes`
- All hashes match: `yes`
- Interpretation: the outside-rerun command surface rebuilds the learned/formal Chapter 17 evidence chain and then independently verifies the replication-pack hashes
