This package is the reproducibility and validation surface for the manuscript. The fair brag is not that it proves everything by existing. It is that the repo already contains a broad, explicit rerun surface: runtime tests, benchmark harnesses, formal artifacts, figure generation, and external-reviewer entry points.

Adjacent to this companion package, the same repository now carries a bounded cover-space audit surface for the manuscript's theorem-indexed failure vocabulary: `open-source/aeon-logic/src/crypto-cover-space.ts`, the GG corpus in `open-source/gnosis/examples/crypto`, and the red/blue reporting wrapper in `open-source/aeon-crackerjack`. That surface is included here as a documentation-level corollary witness, not as a new mechanized theorem family. It treats `cracking` as metaphorical corollary extraction with preserved witness ancestry, and it calibrates two safe families: offline-risk password-digest negative controls and socio-technical recovery/trust topologies.

For readers who want a tiny host-language sketch before they wade into the larger schedulers, the companion source tree now also includes `src/wallington-worthington-reference.ts`: a stripped-down Wallington Rotation / Worthington Whip implementation over plain arrays, paired with the minimal Gnosis examples in `open-source/gnosis/examples/transformer/wallington-rotation.gg` and `open-source/gnosis/examples/transformer/worthington-whip.gg`.

The formal subtree also distinguishes mechanized theorems from theorem-indexed derived vocabulary such as `optionality` and `structured ambiguity processor`, and it now documents a finite/countable/measurable finite-type Landauer calibration boundary plus an observable-pushforward shell relating equiprobable frontier erasure, arbitrary finite-support branch-law entropy, the sharp finite equality cases, arbitrary Bernoulli binary erasure, the countable-support entropy/heat shells, coarse-grained finite/countable observable codomains for arbitrary source PMFs, finite-effective-support source-side monotonicity under deterministic observable coarsening, and the direct finite-type measurable entropy/heat lifts to the existing deterministic-collapse failure-tax floor and the beauty-side deficit/tax/observable bridge stack that isolates exactly what is still missing for the unconditional zero-deficit floor target; see [formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md](./formal/THEOREM_LEDGER.md).

The shared compiler-facing proof workspace in [../../../../../gnosis/GnosisProofs.lean](../../../../../gnosis/GnosisProofs.lean) is part of that rerun surface too. It now carries the bounded affine queue-family `continuousHarris` package emitted by Betti, including the generated `*_measurable_observable`, `*_measurable_observable_drift`, and `*_measurable_continuous_harris_certified` theorem family over the queue-support kernel, alongside the bounded inter-app handoff theorem. The remaining compiler-side gap is narrower and explicit: syntax still does not synthesize measurable small sets, minorization data, richer Lyapunov families, or non-queue measurable kernels from `.gg` source.

If you are coming in fresh, start with [../ch17-external-reviewer-quickstart.md](../ch17-external-reviewer-quickstart.md) before dropping into the per-harness commands below.

## Compiler-Side Formal Rerun

```bash
cd /Users/buley/Documents/Code/emotions/open-source/aeon/docs/ebooks/145-log-rolling-pipelined-prefill/companion-tests
bun run test:formal:gnosis
```

Use that command when you want the shared compiler-facing theorem workspace itself rather than the manuscript-facing rerun harness. It wraps `lake build GnosisProofs` and rechecks the emitted-kernel bounded affine `continuousHarris` witness package, the measurable/geometric queue endpoints, and the bounded inter-app tethering theorems that the Chapter 17 ledger cites under `THM-GNOSIS-*`.

`bun run test:formal:gnosis` wraps the shared `open-source/gnosis/GnosisProofs.lean` Lake build, including the bounded affine queue-family `continuousHarris` witness package, the measurable/geometric queue endpoints, and the bounded coupled-kernel tethering result for inter-app handoff pressure.

## Dependencies

This test suite depends on `@anthropic-ai/aeon` (runtime protocol/compression primitives) and `@a0n/aeon-logic` (self-hosted TLC/TLA parser, Lean sandbox, and formal compatibility adapters).
