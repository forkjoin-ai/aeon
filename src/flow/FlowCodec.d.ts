/**
 * Aeon Flow Codec — Binary Frame Layer
 *
 * Encodes and decodes FlowFrames into a compact 10-byte header + payload
 * binary wire format. Optionally accelerated by WASM; falls back to pure JS.
 *
 * Wire format (10 bytes header):
 *   [0..1]  stream_id  u16 big-endian
 *   [2..5]  sequence   u32 big-endian
 *   [6]     flags      u8
 *   [7..9]  length     u24 big-endian (payload bytes, max 16 MB)
 *
 * The codec is zerocopy where possible: decode returns a Uint8Array view
 * into the original buffer rather than copying payload bytes.
 *
 * @see docs/ebooks/145-log-rolling-pipelined-prefill/ch14-aeon-flow-protocol.md
