/**
 * Aeon Flow Protocol — Stream Multiplexing with Fork/Race/Fold
 *
 * The Flow Layer sits between the Frame Layer (FlowCodec) and the
 * Application Layer (inference, ESI, sync, shell, speculate). It manages
 * multiplexed streams with three protocol-level primitives:
 *
 * - **Fork**: Create N child streams from a parent stream. Each child
 *   runs independently. Used for parallel pipelines, fragment fetching,
 *   reality branching.
 *
 * - **Race**: Mark streams as racing. The first to send a FIN frame wins.
 *   Losers are automatically vented. Used for speculative decoding,
 *   cache races, A/B testing.
 *
 * - **Fold**: Wait for all streams to complete (or vent), then
 *   merge their results via a caller-provided function. Used for shard
 *   assembly, fragment stitching, branch reconciliation.
 *
 * Stream IDs: even = client-initiated, odd = server-initiated (like HTTP/2).
 * Backpressure via per-stream high-water mark (configurable, default 64).
 * Vent propagates from parent to all descendants.
 *
 * @see docs/ebooks/145-log-rolling-pipelined-prefill/ch14-aeon-flow-protocol.md
