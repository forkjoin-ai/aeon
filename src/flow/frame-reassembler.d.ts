/**
 * Frame Reassembler — Out-of-Order Frame Reconstruction
 *
 * Over TCP/WebSocket, frames arrive in order. Over UDP, they don't.
 * The flow header's stream_id (u16) + sequence (u32) already carry
 * the information needed to reassemble — this module uses it.
 *
 * Per-stream reorder buffer with configurable window. Frames arriving
 * out of order are buffered until the gap fills. Frames arriving
 * beyond the window are dropped (assumed lost, will be retransmitted).
 *
 * This is the same insight as QUIC: per-stream ordering eliminates
 * head-of-line blocking across streams. Stream A's lost packet doesn't
 * block Stream B. Only Stream A waits for its own retransmission.
